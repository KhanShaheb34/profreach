It's a solid concept — a professor outreach tracker for grad school applications. Here are my questions:\n\n**Tech Stack**\n1. I see this is a Next.js project. Are you good with using Next.js App Router + React for this? Any preference on styling — Tailwind, shadcn/ui, or something else?\n2. For the AI features (professor lookup, email drafting, chat), you mentioned Gemini/Google. Do you have a Gemini API key ready, or would you prefer a different LLM provider?\n\n**Professor Discovery**\n3. When you paste a professor's name + university or their website link, what should happen exactly? Should the AI scrape/search for their info automatically, or just pre-fill fields that you then verify?\n4. What specific info do you want fetched per professor? I see: university, country, hiring status, research area. Anything else — like email address, lab members, recent publications, h-index?\n\n**Email Drafting**\n5. Should the email drafts be stored per professor (one draft per professor), or should you be able to have multiple draft versions?\n6. Do you want predefined email templates (cold outreach, follow-up, thank you) or fully AI-generated each time?\n\n**Chat Interface**\n7. The chatbox on each professor's page — is this a general-purpose AI chat scoped to that professor's context? Like you could say \"update their research area to NLP\" or \"draft a follow-up email\" and it handles it?\n8. Should the chat history be persisted per professor?\n\n**Smart Memory**\n9. For the memory system — should it be fully automatic (AI extracts key info from chats) or should you also be able to manually add/edit/delete memory items?\n10. When you say \"intelligently suggested\" during email drafting — do you mean inline suggestions while typing, or more like a sidebar with relevant memory snippets?\n\n**Documents & Profile**\n11. For resume upload — should the app parse the PDF and extract structured data (name, education, publications, skills) to build your profile automatically?\n12. Besides resume, do you actually need to upload and store other documents (transcripts, SOP, LORs) within the app, or is the resume enough for now?\n\n**Status & Workflow**\n13. The statuses you listed are: Not Contacted, Email Drafted, Email Sent, Interview Scheduled. Any others? Like \"Responded\", \"Rejected\", \"Accepted\", \"Applied to Lab\"?\n14. Should there be any reminder/notification system — like \"you drafted an email 3 days ago but haven't sent it\"?\n\n**Data & Export**\n15. For CSV export — should it export everything (professors, emails, notes) or just the professor list?\n16. Any need for data import? Like bulk-adding professors from a spreadsheet?\n\n**Scope for v1**\n17. Do you want to build everything at once, or would you prefer to start with a core MVP (dashboard + professor pages + basic email drafting) and layer on the AI features iteratively?\n\nTake your time answering — we'll nail down the spec before writing any code."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":17204,"cache_read_input_tokens":15537,"output_tokens":881,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":17204,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}}},"requestId":"req_011CYCAYkwUGcB1ZW4PQeF6x","type":"assistant","uuid":"f40433ee-4698-43ab-ac14-e035599c316c","timestamp":"2026-02-16T17:46:19.515Z"}

Track professors, research their backgrounds via AI, draft personalized emails, and manage application documents — all in one place.\n\nBuilt with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Gemini API**. All data stored in **localStorage** behind a clean abstraction layer for easy migration to a database + Clerk auth later.\n\n---\n\n## Pages & Features\n\n### 1. Dashboard (`/`)\n\nThe main hub. A searchable, filterable list of all tracked professors.\n\n**Add Professor Input**\n- A prominent input field at the top\n- User enters either: professor name + university, OR a profile/lab website URL\n- On submit, Gemini (with Google Search grounding) fetches and populates professor info automatically\n- User can review and edit the auto-filled data before saving\n\n**Professor List**\n- Card/table view showing key info per professor:\n  - Name, University, Department, Country\n  - Research Area, Hiring Status, Email\n  - Application Status (see below)\n  - Last Contact Date\n- Clicking a professor navigates to their detail page\n\n**Filtering & Sorting**\n- Filter by: University, Country, Research Area, Hiring Status, Application Status\n- Sort by: Name, University, Date Added, Last Contact Date\n- Search across all fields\n\n**Application Statuses**\n- `Not Contacted` — default\n- `Researching` — gathering info, reading papers\n- `Email Drafted` — draft written but not sent\n- `Email Sent` — outreach sent\n- `Followed Up` — sent a follow-up\n- `Responded` — professor replied\n- `Interview Scheduled` — interview/meeting set up\n- `Applied to Lab` — formal application submitted\n- `Accepted` — got in\n- `Rejected` — declined or no response after follow-up\n- `On Hold` — paused for any reason\n\n### 2. Professor Detail Page (`/professor/[id]`)\n\nA dedicated page for each professor with all their info, email drafting, and an AI chat.\n\n**Professor Info Panel**\n- All stored info displayed and editable:\n  - Name, Email, University, Department, Country\n  - Research Areas (tags)\n  - Currently Hiring (Yes / No / Unknown)\n  - H-index, Google Scholar link, Lab/Profile URL\n  - Key Publications (title + link, up to ~5)\n  - Notes (free-text)\n- Application status selector\n- Last contact date\n\n**Email Drafting Section**\n- One draft per professor\n- \"Generate Draft\" button — uses Gemini to create a personalized cold outreach email using:\n  - Professor's info (research area, publications, hiring status)\n  - User's profile (resume data, research interests, background)\n  - Smart Memory (relevant past insights)\n- Rich text editor to manually edit the generated draft\n- Predefined templates available: Cold Outreach, Follow-Up, Thank You\n- \"Copy to Clipboard\" button for easy pasting into email client\n- Draft is auto-saved\n\n**AI Chat**\n- A chat interface scoped to this professor's context\n- Can be used to:\n  - Update professor info (\"change their research area to NLP\")\n  - Refine the email draft (\"make it shorter\", \"mention my ML experience\")\n  - Ask questions (\"what papers has this professor published recently?\")\n  - General conversation about the professor or application strategy\n- Chat has full context: professor info, user profile, smart memory, current draft\n- Chat history is persisted per professor\n- Key information from chat is automatically extracted into Smart Memory\n\n### 3. Profile Page (`/profile`)\n\nUser's personal info and application materials.\n\n**Personal Info**\n- Name, Email, University/Institution\n- Degree Pursuing (Masters / PhD)\n- Research Interests (tags)\n- Brief Bio / Summary\n- Can be auto-populated from resume via Gemini, or manually entered/edited\n\n**Resume Upload & Parsing**\n- Upload a PDF resume\n- Gemini parses it to extract structured data: education, publications, skills, experience, research interests\n- Extracted data is used to populate profile fields (user can review/edit)\n- Resume PDF is stored (in localStorage as base64) and downloadable\n\n**Document Management**\n- Upload and categorize documents:\n  - CV / Resume\n  - Transcripts\n  - Statement of Purpose (SOP)\n  - Letters of Recommendation (LOR)\n  - Other\n- Each document: name, category, upload date, file (stored as base64)\n- Download and delete functionality\n\n**Smart Memory**\n- A list of key insights extracted from professor page chats\n- Each memory item: text content, source (which professor chat), date, tags\n- Automatically populated by AI during chats\n- User can manually add, edit, and delete items\n- Searchable\n- Used by the email drafting assistant across all professors\n\n### 4. Data Export / Import\n\n- **Export**: Full JSON export of all data (professors, drafts, profile, documents metadata, smart memory, chat histories)\n- Documents exported separately (or included as base64 in JSON)\n- One-click export from a settings area or profile page\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Stack\n- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)\n- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (via /frontend-design skill)\n- **AI**: Gemini API (with Google Search grounding for professor lookup)\n- **Storage**: localStorage with abstraction layer\n- **PDF Parsing**: Gemini (send PDF, extract structured data)\n\n### Data Abstraction Layer\nAll data access goes through a `storage` service:\n```\nstorage.professors.getAll()\nstorage.professors.getById(id)\nstorage.professors.create(data)\nstorage.professors.update(id, data)\nstorage.professors.delete(id)\n\nstorage.profile.get()\nstorage.profile.update(data)\n\nstorage.documents.getAll()\nstorage.documents.upload(file, category)\nstorage.documents.delete(id)\n\nstorage.memory.getAll()\nstorage.memory.add(item)\nstorage.memory.update(id, item)\nstorage.memory.delete(id)\n\nstorage.chats.getByProfessorId(id)\nstorage.chats.addMessage(professorId, message)\n\nstorage.drafts.getByProfessorId(id)\nstorage.drafts.save(professorId, content)\n\nstorage.export() // returns full JSON\n```\nThis layer currently reads/writes to localStorage. When migrating to a database, only this layer needs to change.\n\n### Gemini API Usage\n- **Professor Lookup**: Gemini with Google Search grounding — given a name+university or URL, returns structured professor data\n- **Email Drafting**: Gemini generates personalized emails using professor info + user profile + smart memory\n- **Chat**: Gemini-powered conversational interface per professor page\n- **Resume Parsing**: Gemini extracts structured data from uploaded PDF\n- **Smart Memory Extraction**: After each chat interaction, Gemini identifies key info worth remembering\n\n### Data Models\n\n**Professor**\n```\nid, name, email, university, department, country,\nresearchAreas[], hiringStatus (yes/no/unknown),\nhIndex, googleScholarUrl, labUrl, profileUrl,\nkeyPublications[{title, url}],\nnotes, status, lastContactDate,\ncreatedAt, updatedAt\n```\n\n**Profile**\n```\nname, email, university, degreePursuing,\nresearchInterests[], bio, resumeBase64, resumeFileName\n```\n\n**Document**\n```\nid, name, category, fileBase64, fileName, mimeType,\nuploadedAt\n```\n\n**Memory Item**\n```\nid, content, sourceProfessorId, sourceProfessorName,\ntags[], createdAt\n```\n\n**Chat Message**\n```\nid, professorId, role (user/assistant), content, createdAt\n```\n\n**Email Draft**\n```\nprofessorId, content, template (cold/followup/thankyou),\nlastGeneratedAt, lastEditedAt\n```\n\n---\n\n## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)\n- Clerk authentication + database migration (Supabase/Postgres)\n- Multi-user support\n- Email sending directly from the app (Gmail/Outlook integration)\n- Calendar integration for interview scheduling\n- Analytics dashboard (response rates, outreach funnel)\n- Browser extension to add professors from university websites\n- Cost optimization for Gemini API calls (caching, rate limiting)\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":923,"cache_read_input_tokens":34382,"output_tokens":2089,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":923,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}}},"requestId":"req_011CYCBWCXdZWwAnBMxfTADm","type":"assistant","uuid":"54e1f06c-d5ce-44c7-ac2d-a4bb7d0278c1","timestamp":"2026-02-16T17:59:15.559Z"}

And for that I'm looking for professors who are hiring students and trying to outreach them through mail or applying directly to their labs. And for this I want a web app where I can track professors, their information, important papers, documents, etc, and draft emails. What I want is a dashboard where there will be an input box where I can send a professor's name and university or their profile/lab website link, and gemini/google will find information about them and there will be a list of professors with important information like university, country, currently hiring or not. And the list should be filterable properly. Each professor will have a page of their own, and that page can be reached from the dashboard, where there will be important information about them and a place to generate and edit draft email, there will also be a chatbox and using that I should be able to update any information or draft email for that professor. Dashboard will show the current status of the professor, if I sent the mail or not, if I've drafted it or not. There will also be a profile page where I can upload my resume along with information about me. There will be a memory box on the profile too, that should be updated automatically as we chat on professor page for important information that might be useful while sending mail to other professors too.

The database should include fields for Professor Name, University, Department, Country, Research Area, Currently Hiring (Yes/No), Last Contact Date, and Status (e.g., 'Not Contacted', 'Email Drafted', 'Email Sent', 'Interview Scheduled'). Implement advanced filtering options for University, Country, Research Area, and Hiring Status. Allow users to add new professor entries and edit existing ones.","+A personal web app to manage graduate/PhD application outreach to professors. Track professors, research their backgrounds via AI, draft personalized emails, and manage application documents — all in one place."," ","-Implement a document management system where users can upload, store, and categorize important application documents. This should include a dedicated section for CV/Resume, Transcripts, Statement of Purpose, and Letters of Recommendation. Allow users to easily access and download these documents when needed for applications or email attachments.","+Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Gemini API**. All data stored in **localStorage** behind a clean abstraction layer for easy migration to a database + Clerk auth later."," ","-Create a 'Smart Memory' feature. This system should analyze chat interactions on professor pages to identify and store key pieces of information (e.g., specific research interests mentioned, recent publications, funding opportunities, personal anecdotes).
