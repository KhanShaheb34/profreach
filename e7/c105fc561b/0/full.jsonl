It's a solid concept — a professor outreach tracker for grad school applications. Here are my questions:\n\n**Tech Stack**\n1. I see this is a Next.js project. Are you good with using Next.js App Router + React for this? Any preference on styling — Tailwind, shadcn/ui, or something else?\n2. For the AI features (professor lookup, email drafting, chat), you mentioned Gemini/Google. Do you have a Gemini API key ready, or would you prefer a different LLM provider?\n\n**Professor Discovery**\n3. When you paste a professor's name + university or their website link, what should happen exactly? Should the AI scrape/search for their info automatically, or just pre-fill fields that you then verify?\n4. What specific info do you want fetched per professor? I see: university, country, hiring status, research area. Anything else — like email address, lab members, recent publications, h-index?\n\n**Email Drafting**\n5. Should the email drafts be stored per professor (one draft per professor), or should you be able to have multiple draft versions?\n6. Do you want predefined email templates (cold outreach, follow-up, thank you) or fully AI-generated each time?\n\n**Chat Interface**\n7. The chatbox on each professor's page — is this a general-purpose AI chat scoped to that professor's context? Like you could say \"update their research area to NLP\" or \"draft a follow-up email\" and it handles it?\n8. Should the chat history be persisted per professor?\n\n**Smart Memory**\n9. For the memory system — should it be fully automatic (AI extracts key info from chats) or should you also be able to manually add/edit/delete memory items?\n10. When you say \"intelligently suggested\" during email drafting — do you mean inline suggestions while typing, or more like a sidebar with relevant memory snippets?\n\n**Documents & Profile**\n11. For resume upload — should the app parse the PDF and extract structured data (name, education, publications, skills) to build your profile automatically?\n12. Besides resume, do you actually need to upload and store other documents (transcripts, SOP, LORs) within the app, or is the resume enough for now?\n\n**Status & Workflow**\n13. The statuses you listed are: Not Contacted, Email Drafted, Email Sent, Interview Scheduled. Any others? Like \"Responded\", \"Rejected\", \"Accepted\", \"Applied to Lab\"?\n14. Should there be any reminder/notification system — like \"you drafted an email 3 days ago but haven't sent it\"?\n\n**Data & Export**\n15. For CSV export — should it export everything (professors, emails, notes) or just the professor list?\n16. Any need for data import? Like bulk-adding professors from a spreadsheet?\n\n**Scope for v1**\n17. Do you want to build everything at once, or would you prefer to start with a core MVP (dashboard + professor pages + basic email drafting) and layer on the AI features iteratively?\n\nTake your time answering — we'll nail down the spec before writing any code."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":17204,"cache_read_input_tokens":15537,"output_tokens":881,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":17204,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}}},"requestId":"req_011CYCAYkwUGcB1ZW4PQeF6x","type":"assistant","uuid":"f40433ee-4698-43ab-ac14-e035599c316c","timestamp":"2026-02-16T17:46:19.515Z"}

Track professors, research their backgrounds via AI, draft personalized emails, and manage application documents — all in one place.\n\nBuilt with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Gemini API**. All data stored in **localStorage** behind a clean abstraction layer for easy migration to a database + Clerk auth later.\n\n---\n\n## Pages & Features\n\n### 1. Dashboard (`/`)\n\nThe main hub. A searchable, filterable list of all tracked professors.\n\n**Add Professor Input**\n- A prominent input field at the top\n- User enters either: professor name + university, OR a profile/lab website URL\n- On submit, Gemini (with Google Search grounding) fetches and populates professor info automatically\n- User can review and edit the auto-filled data before saving\n\n**Professor List**\n- Card/table view showing key info per professor:\n  - Name, University, Department, Country\n  - Research Area, Hiring Status, Email\n  - Application Status (see below)\n  - Last Contact Date\n- Clicking a professor navigates to their detail page\n\n**Filtering & Sorting**\n- Filter by: University, Country, Research Area, Hiring Status, Application Status\n- Sort by: Name, University, Date Added, Last Contact Date\n- Search across all fields\n\n**Application Statuses**\n- `Not Contacted` — default\n- `Researching` — gathering info, reading papers\n- `Email Drafted` — draft written but not sent\n- `Email Sent` — outreach sent\n- `Followed Up` — sent a follow-up\n- `Responded` — professor replied\n- `Interview Scheduled` — interview/meeting set up\n- `Applied to Lab` — formal application submitted\n- `Accepted` — got in\n- `Rejected` — declined or no response after follow-up\n- `On Hold` — paused for any reason\n\n### 2. Professor Detail Page (`/professor/[id]`)\n\nA dedicated page for each professor with all their info, email drafting, and an AI chat.\n\n**Professor Info Panel**\n- All stored info displayed and editable:\n  - Name, Email, University, Department, Country\n  - Research Areas (tags)\n  - Currently Hiring (Yes / No / Unknown)\n  - H-index, Google Scholar link, Lab/Profile URL\n  - Key Publications (title + link, up to ~5)\n  - Notes (free-text)\n- Application status selector\n- Last contact date\n\n**Email Drafting Section**\n- One draft per professor\n- \"Generate Draft\" button — uses Gemini to create a personalized cold outreach email using:\n  - Professor's info (research area, publications, hiring status)\n  - User's profile (resume data, research interests, background)\n  - Smart Memory (relevant past insights)\n- Rich text editor to manually edit the generated draft\n- Predefined templates available: Cold Outreach, Follow-Up, Thank You\n- \"Copy to Clipboard\" button for easy pasting into email client\n- Draft is auto-saved\n\n**AI Chat**\n- A chat interface scoped to this professor's context\n- Can be used to:\n  - Update professor info (\"change their research area to NLP\")\n  - Refine the email draft (\"make it shorter\", \"mention my ML experience\")\n  - Ask questions (\"what papers has this professor published recently?\")\n  - General conversation about the professor or application strategy\n- Chat has full context: professor info, user profile, smart memory, current draft\n- Chat history is persisted per professor\n- Key information from chat is automatically extracted into Smart Memory\n\n### 3. Profile Page (`/profile`)\n\nUser's personal info and application materials.\n\n**Personal Info**\n- Name, Email, University/Institution\n- Degree Pursuing (Masters / PhD)\n- Research Interests (tags)\n- Brief Bio / Summary\n- Can be auto-populated from resume via Gemini, or manually entered/edited\n\n**Resume Upload & Parsing**\n- Upload a PDF resume\n- Gemini parses it to extract structured data: education, publications, skills, experience, research interests\n- Extracted data is used to populate profile fields (user can review/edit)\n- Resume PDF is stored (in localStorage as base64) and downloadable\n\n**Document Management**\n- Upload and categorize documents:\n  - CV / Resume\n  - Transcripts\n  - Statement of Purpose (SOP)\n  - Letters of Recommendation (LOR)\n  - Other\n- Each document: name, category, upload date, file (stored as base64)\n- Download and delete functionality\n\n**Smart Memory**\n- A list of key insights extracted from professor page chats\n- Each memory item: text content, source (which professor chat), date, tags\n- Automatically populated by AI during chats\n- User can manually add, edit, and delete items\n- Searchable\n- Used by the email drafting assistant across all professors\n\n### 4. Data Export / Import\n\n- **Export**: Full JSON export of all data (professors, drafts, profile, documents metadata, smart memory, chat histories)\n- Documents exported separately (or included as base64 in JSON)\n- One-click export from a settings area or profile page\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Stack\n- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)\n- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (via /frontend-design skill)\n- **AI**: Gemini API (with Google Search grounding for professor lookup)\n- **Storage**: localStorage with abstraction layer\n- **PDF Parsing**: Gemini (send PDF, extract structured data)\n\n### Data Abstraction Layer\nAll data access goes through a `storage` service:\n```\nstorage.professors.getAll()\nstorage.professors.getById(id)\nstorage.professors.create(data)\nstorage.professors.update(id, data)\nstorage.professors.delete(id)\n\nstorage.profile.get()\nstorage.profile.update(data)\n\nstorage.documents.getAll()\nstorage.documents.upload(file, category)\nstorage.documents.delete(id)\n\nstorage.memory.getAll()\nstorage.memory.add(item)\nstorage.memory.update(id, item)\nstorage.memory.delete(id)\n\nstorage.chats.getByProfessorId(id)\nstorage.chats.addMessage(professorId, message)\n\nstorage.drafts.getByProfessorId(id)\nstorage.drafts.save(professorId, content)\n\nstorage.export() // returns full JSON\n```\nThis layer currently reads/writes to localStorage. When migrating to a database, only this layer needs to change.\n\n### Gemini API Usage\n- **Professor Lookup**: Gemini with Google Search grounding — given a name+university or URL, returns structured professor data\n- **Email Drafting**: Gemini generates personalized emails using professor info + user profile + smart memory\n- **Chat**: Gemini-powered conversational interface per professor page\n- **Resume Parsing**: Gemini extracts structured data from uploaded PDF\n- **Smart Memory Extraction**: After each chat interaction, Gemini identifies key info worth remembering\n\n### Data Models\n\n**Professor**\n```\nid, name, email, university, department, country,\nresearchAreas[], hiringStatus (yes/no/unknown),\nhIndex, googleScholarUrl, labUrl, profileUrl,\nkeyPublications[{title, url}],\nnotes, status, lastContactDate,\ncreatedAt, updatedAt\n```\n\n**Profile**\n```\nname, email, university, degreePursuing,\nresearchInterests[], bio, resumeBase64, resumeFileName\n```\n\n**Document**\n```\nid, name, category, fileBase64, fileName, mimeType,\nuploadedAt\n```\n\n**Memory Item**\n```\nid, content, sourceProfessorId, sourceProfessorName,\ntags[], createdAt\n```\n\n**Chat Message**\n```\nid, professorId, role (user/assistant), content, createdAt\n```\n\n**Email Draft**\n```\nprofessorId, content, template (cold/followup/thankyou),\nlastGeneratedAt, lastEditedAt\n```\n\n---\n\n## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)\n- Clerk authentication + database migration (Supabase/Postgres)\n- Multi-user support\n- Email sending directly from the app (Gmail/Outlook integration)\n- Calendar integration for interview scheduling\n- Analytics dashboard (response rates, outreach funnel)\n- Browser extension to add professors from university websites\n- Cost optimization for Gemini API calls (caching, rate limiting)\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":923,"cache_read_input_tokens":34382,"output_tokens":2089,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":923,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}}},"requestId":"req_011CYCBWCXdZWwAnBMxfTADm","type":"assistant","uuid":"54e1f06c-d5ce-44c7-ac2d-a4bb7d0278c1","timestamp":"2026-02-16T17:59:15.559Z"}

And the list should be filterable properly.

The database should include fields for Professor Name, University, Department, Country, Research Area, Currently Hiring (Yes/No), Last Contact Date, and Status (e.g., 'Not Contacted', 'Email Drafted', 'Email Sent', 'Interview Scheduled'). Implement advanced filtering options for University, Country, Research Area, and Hiring Status. Allow users to add new professor entries and edit existing ones.","+A personal web app to manage graduate/PhD application outreach to professors. Track professors, research their backgrounds via AI, draft personalized emails, and manage application documents — all in one place."," ","-Implement a document management system where users can upload, store, and categorize important application documents. This should include a dedicated section for CV/Resume, Transcripts, Statement of Purpose, and Letters of Recommendation. Allow users to easily access and download these documents when needed for applications or email attachments.","+Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Gemini API**. All data stored in **localStorage** behind a clean abstraction layer for easy migration to a database + Clerk auth later."," ","-Create a 'Smart Memory' feature. This system should analyze chat interactions on professor pages to identify and store key pieces of information (e.g., specific research interests mentioned, recent publications, funding opportunities, personal anecdotes).

Contains 57 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.\n\n## When to Apply\n\nReference these guidelines when:\n- Writing new React components or Next.js pages\n- Implementing data fetching (client or server-side)\n- Reviewing code for performance issues\n- Refactoring existing React/Next.js code\n- Optimizing bundle size or load times\n\n## Rule Categories by Priority\n\n| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |\n|----------|----------|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Eliminating Waterfalls | CRITICAL | `async-` |\n| 2 | Bundle Size Optimization | CRITICAL | `bundle-` |\n| 3 | Server-Side Performance | HIGH | `server-` |\n| 4 | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH | `client-` |\n| 5 | Re-render Optimization | MEDIUM | `rerender-` |\n| 6 | Rendering Performance | MEDIUM | `rendering-` |\n| 7 | JavaScript Performance | LOW-MEDIUM | `js-` |\n| 8 | Advanced Patterns | LOW | `advanced-` |\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### 1. Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)\n\n- `async-defer-await` - Move await into branches where actually used\n- `async-parallel` - Use Promise.all() for independent operations\n- `async-dependencies` - Use better-all for partial dependencies\n- `async-api-routes` - Start promises early, await late in API routes\n- `async-suspense-boundaries` - Use Suspense to stream content\n\n### 2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)\n\n- `bundle-barrel-imports` - Import directly, avoid barrel files\n- `bundle-dynamic-imports` - Use next/dynamic for heavy components\n- `bundle-defer-third-party` - Load analytics/logging after hydration\n- `bundle-conditional` - Load modules only when feature is activated\n- `bundle-preload` - Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed\n\n### 3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)\n\n- `server-auth-actions` - Authenticate server actions like API routes\n- `server-cache-react` - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication\n- `server-cache-lru` - Use LRU cache for cross-request caching\n- `server-dedup-props` - Avoid duplicate serialization in RSC props\n- `server-serialization` - Minimize data passed to client components\n- `server-parallel-fetching` - Restructure components to parallelize fetches\n- `server-after-nonblocking` - Use after() for non-blocking operations\n\n### 4. Client-Side Data Fetching (MEDIUM-HIGH)\n\n- `client-swr-dedup` - Use SWR for automatic request deduplication\n- `client-event-listeners` - Deduplicate global event listeners\n- `client-passive-event-listeners` - Use passive listeners for scroll\n- `client-localstorage-schema` - Version and minimize localStorage data\n\n### 5. Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)\n\n- `rerender-defer-reads` - Don't subscribe to state only used in callbacks\n- `rerender-memo` - Extract expensive work into memoized components\n- `rerender-memo-with-default-value` - Hoist default non-primitive props\n- `rerender-dependencies` - Use primitive dependencies in effects\n- `rerender-derived-state` - Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw values\n- `rerender-derived-state-no-effect` - Derive state during render, not effects\n- `rerender-functional-setstate` - Use functional setState for stable callbacks\n- `rerender-lazy-state-init` - Pass function to useState for expensive values\n- `rerender-simple-expression-in-memo` - Avoid memo for simple primitives\n- `rerender-move-effect-to-event` - Put interaction logic in event handlers\n- `rerender-transitions` - Use startTransition for non-urgent updates\n- `rerender-use-ref-transient-values` - Use refs for transient frequent values\n\n### 6. Rendering Performance (MEDIUM)\n\n- `rendering-animate-svg-wrapper` - Animate div wrapper, not SVG element\n- `rendering-content-visibility` - Use content-visibility for long lists\n- `rendering-hoist-jsx` - Extract static JSX outside components\n- `rendering-svg-precision` - Reduce SVG coordinate precision\n- `rendering-hydration-no-flicker` - Use inline script for client-only data\n- `rendering-hydration-suppress-warning` - Suppress expected mismatches\n- `rendering-activity` - Use Activity component for show/hide\n- `rendering-conditional-render` - Use ternary, not && for conditionals\n- `rendering-usetransition-loading` - Prefer useTransition for loading state\n\n### 7. JavaScript Performance (LOW-MEDIUM)\n\n- `js-batch-dom-css` - Group CSS changes via classes or cssText\n- `js-index-maps` - Build Map for repeated lookups\n- `js-cache-property-access` - Cache object properties in loops\n- `js-cache-function-results` - Cache function results in module-level Map\n- `js-cache-storage` - Cache localStorage/sessionStorage reads\n- `js-combine-iterations` - Combine multiple filter/map into one loop\n- `js-length-check-first` - Check array length before expensive comparison\n- `js-early-exit` - Return early from functions\n- `js-hoist-regexp` - Hoist RegExp creation outside loops\n- `js-min-max-loop` - Use loop for min/max instead of sort\n- `js-set-map-lookups` - Use Set/Map for O(1) lookups\n- `js-tosorted-immutable` - Use toSorted() for immutability\n\n### 8. Advanced Patterns (LOW)\n\n- `advanced-event-handler-refs` - Store event handlers in refs\n- `advanced-init-once` - Initialize app once per app load\n- `advanced-use-latest` - useLatest for stable callback refs\n\n## How to Use\n\nRead individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:\n\n```\nrules/async-parallel.md\nrules/bundle-barrel-imports.md\n```\n\nEach rule file contains:\n- Brief explanation of why it matters\n- Incorrect code example with explanation\n- Correct code example with explanation\n- Additional context and references\n\n## Full Compiled Document\n\nFor the complete guide with all rules expanded: `AGENTS.md`\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"ff6d4d55-3a28-424d-ac09-f9e950e6031c","timestamp":"2026-02-16T18:04:37.348Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01WdQ3GuehoRozHZCUSjBRFy"}

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"8456dedb-0981-4f26-baeb-c4bd088e1396","timestamp":"2026-02-16T18:04:41.812Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01Gm19wCfqsNfCgvA87nT5JF"}

Group into logical milestones that can be committed separately. Consider:\n1. What order to build things (foundation first, then features)\n2. Which packages need to be installed (shadcn/ui, @google/generative-ai, uuid, etc.)\n3. File structure for the app\n4. How to structure the storage layer\n5. How to structure Gemini API routes\n6.

All data lives in localStorage behind an abstraction layer. Four pages: Dashboard, Professor Detail, Profile, and Data Export.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 0: Project Setup and Dependencies\n\n**Goal:** Install all packages, initialize shadcn/ui, set up project scaffolding.\n\n### Step 0.1 -- Install packages\n\nRun via pnpm:\n\n```\npnpm add @google/generative-ai uuid lucide-react sonner\npnpm add -D @types/uuid\n```\n\n### Step 0.2 -- Initialize shadcn/ui\n\n```\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\nDuring init, select:\n- Style: New York\n- Base color: Zinc (or Neutral -- pick what fits your \"distinctive\" design goal)\n- CSS variables: yes\n\nThis will create:\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components.json`\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/utils.ts` (cn utility)\n- Updates to `globals.css` with CSS variables\n\n### Step 0.3 -- Install shadcn/ui components\n\nInstall all needed components upfront:\n\n```\npnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button input label textarea select badge card dialog dropdown-menu tabs separator scroll-area sheet tooltip avatar command popover skeleton toast\n```\n\n### Step 0.4 -- Create `.env.local`\n\n```\nGEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here\n```\n\nUpdate `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/.gitignore` to include `.env.local` (Next.js already does this by default).\n\n### Step 0.5 -- Update `next.config.ts`\n\nAdd `serverExternalPackages` if needed for any server-side only libs.

It wraps localStorage behind a clean API so a future database migration only changes this one file.\n\nDesign principles:\n- Each \"collection\" (professors, documents, memory, chats, drafts) gets its own localStorage key: `profreach_professors`, `profreach_profile`, etc.\n- All reads/writes go through helper functions that handle JSON serialization.\n- Every mutation triggers a `CustomEvent` on `window` so React hooks can re-render.\n\n```typescript\nconst STORAGE_KEYS = {\n  professors: 'profreach_professors',\n  profile: 'profreach_profile',\n  documents: 'profreach_documents',\n  memory: 'profreach_memory',\n  chats: 'profreach_chats',\n  drafts: 'profreach_drafts',\n} as const;\n\nconst STORAGE_EVENT = 'profreach-storage-update';\n\nfunction read<T>(key: string, fallback: T): T { ... }\nfunction write<T>(key: string, data: T): void { ... dispatch event }\n\nexport const storage = {\n  professors: {\n    getAll(): Professor[] { return read(STORAGE_KEYS.professors, []); },\n    getById(id: string): Professor | undefined { ... },\n    create(data: Omit<Professor, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>): Professor { ... },\n    update(id: string, data: Partial<Professor>): Professor { ... },\n    delete(id: string): void { ... },\n  },\n  profile: {\n    get(): Profile { return read(STORAGE_KEYS.profile, DEFAULT_PROFILE); },\n    update(data: Partial<Profile>): Profile { ... },\n  },\n  documents: {\n    getAll(): Document[] { ... },\n    create(doc: Omit<Document, 'id' | 'uploadedAt'>): Document { ... },\n    delete(id: string): void { ... },\n  },\n  memory: {\n    getAll(): MemoryItem[] { ... },\n    add(item: Omit<MemoryItem, 'id' | 'createdAt'>): MemoryItem { ... },\n    update(id: string, data: Partial<MemoryItem>): MemoryItem { ... },\n    delete(id: string): void { ... },\n    search(query: string): MemoryItem[] { ... }, // simple text match\n  },\n  chats: {\n    getByProfessorId(professorId: string): ChatMessage[] { ... },\n    addMessage(professorId: string, message: Omit<ChatMessage, 'id' | 'createdAt'>): ChatMessage { ... },\n    clearByProfessorId(professorId: string): void { ... },\n  },\n  drafts: {\n    getByProfessorId(professorId: string): EmailDraft | null { ... },\n    save(professorId: string, data: Partial<EmailDraft>): EmailDraft { ... },\n  },\n  exportAll(): AppData { ... },\n  importAll(data: AppData): void { ... },\n};\n```\n\n### 1.4 -- React Hook for Storage\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/hooks/use-storage.ts`**\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n// Listens for the custom storage event and returns reactive data.\n// Example: const professors = useStorageCollection(() => storage.professors.getAll());\n// Automatically re-renders when storage changes.\nexport function useStorageData<T>(getter: () => T): T { ... }\n```\n\nUses `useSyncExternalStore` for safe concurrent React 19 usage. The subscribe function listens for the `profreach-storage-update` event on `window`.\n\n### 1.5 -- Debounce Hook\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/hooks/use-debounce.ts`**\n\nStandard debounce hook for search input, 300ms default.\n\n### 1.6 -- App Layout and Navigation\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`** (client component)\n\nA vertical sidebar with navigation links:\n- Dashboard (Home icon) -- `/`\n- Profile (User icon) -- `/profile`\n- Export (Download icon) -- `/export`\n\nUse `lucide-react` icons. Highlight active route using `usePathname()`.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/layout/header.tsx`** (server component)\n\nA top bar per page showing page title. Each page passes its own title.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/layout/app-shell.tsx`** (server component)\n\nWraps sidebar + main content area in a flex layout. The sidebar is fixed-width on the left, content scrolls independently.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/providers.tsx`** (client component)\n\nWraps `children` with the `<Toaster />` from sonner (for toast notifications).\n\n**Update: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/layout.tsx`**\n\n- Update metadata title/description to \"Profreach\"\n- Keep Geist fonts\n- Wrap `{children}` in `<Providers>` and `<AppShell>`\n- Update `globals.css` with design tokens for a distinctive look (custom accent color, refined spacing)\n\n**Update: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/globals.css`**\n\n- Keep the Tailwind v4 `@import \"tailwindcss\"` and `@theme inline` block\n- Add custom color variables for the Profreach brand (a warm accent color like amber/orange or a scholarly blue-violet)\n- Add custom scrollbar styles, selection color, focus ring overrides\n\n### Commit: \"feat: add type definitions, storage layer, layout shell, and navigation\"\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Dashboard Page\n\n**Goal:** Build the main professor list view with search, filtering, sorting, and the \"Add Professor\" input.\n\n### Files\n\n```\napp/\n  page.tsx                                -- dashboard server wrapper\ncomponents/\n  dashboard/\n    professor-list.tsx                    -- client: renders professor cards\n    professor-card.tsx                    -- client: single professor card\n    add-professor-input.tsx               -- client: input + Gemini lookup\n    add-professor-dialog.tsx              -- client: review/edit before saving\n    filter-bar.tsx                        -- client: filter/sort/search controls\n    status-badge.tsx                      -- shared status badge component\n    dashboard-stats.tsx                   -- summary stats at top\napp/\n  api/\n    gemini/\n      lookup/route.ts                    -- POST: professor lookup\n```\n\n### 2.1 -- Gemini Server Client\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/gemini.ts`**\n\n```typescript\nimport { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY!);\n\nexport function getGeminiModel(modelName = 'gemini-2.0-flash') {\n  return genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: modelName });\n}\n\n// For search-grounded lookups\nexport function getGroundedModel() {\n  return genAI.getGenerativeModel({\n    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',\n    tools: [{ googleSearchRetrieval: {} }],\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 2.2 -- Professor Lookup API Route\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/lookup/route.ts`**\n\n- Accepts POST with `{ query: string }` (name+university or URL)\n- Uses the grounded Gemini model\n- System prompt instructs Gemini to return a structured JSON matching the `Professor` shape (minus id, createdAt, updatedAt, status)\n- Parses the JSON from Gemini's response, validates it, returns it\n- Error handling for rate limits, malformed responses\n\n### 2.3 -- Dashboard Page\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/page.tsx`**\n\nThis is a server component that renders the page shell. It imports the client components:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport { DashboardStats } from '@/components/dashboard/dashboard-stats';\nimport { AddProfessorInput } from '@/components/dashboard/add-professor-input';\nimport { FilterBar } from '@/components/dashboard/filter-bar';\nimport { ProfessorList } from '@/components/dashboard/professor-list';\n\nexport default function DashboardPage() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"space-y-6\">\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n      <DashboardStats />\n      <AddProfessorInput />\n      <FilterBar />\n      <ProfessorList />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAll the child components are `'use client'` because they read from localStorage.\n\n### 2.4 -- Add Professor Input\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/add-professor-input.tsx`**\n\n- Input field + \"Lookup\" button\n- On submit, calls `/api/gemini/lookup` with the query\n- Shows loading spinner during fetch\n- On success, opens `AddProfessorDialog` with pre-filled data\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/add-professor-dialog.tsx`**\n\n- Dialog/Sheet showing all professor fields pre-filled from Gemini\n- User reviews, edits any fields\n- \"Save\" button calls `storage.professors.create()`\n- Toast notification on success\n\n### 2.5 -- Filter Bar\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/filter-bar.tsx`**\n\n- Search input (debounced, 300ms)\n- Filter dropdowns: Status, Country, Research Area (populated from existing data)\n- Sort dropdown\n- All filter state managed with `useState` -- no URL params needed for localStorage app\n- Passes filter/sort config up to parent via callback or uses a shared state approach\n\nArchitecture decision: Use a simple `useReducer` in the dashboard page to hold filter state, pass it down. No need for global state management.\n\n### 2.6 -- Professor List and Card\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/professor-list.tsx`**\n\n- Reads all professors via `useStorageData(() => storage.professors.getAll())`\n- Applies filters and sorting from props\n- Renders a grid of `ProfessorCard` components\n- Empty state when no professors exist\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/professor-card.tsx`**\n\n- Card showing: name, university, department, country, research areas as badges, status badge, last contact\n- Clicking navigates to `/professor/[id]`\n- Quick status dropdown to change status inline\n- Uses `Link` from `next/link`\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/status-badge.tsx`**\n\n- Reusable component: takes an `ApplicationStatus`, renders a colored badge\n- Uses the color map from `constants.ts`\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/dashboard-stats.tsx`**\n\n- Row of stat cards at the top: Total Professors, Emails Sent, Responses, etc.\n- Computed from professor list statuses\n\n### Commit: \"feat: implement dashboard with professor list, filtering, and AI lookup\"\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Professor Detail Page\n\n**Goal:** Build the full professor detail view with info editing, email drafting, and AI chat.\n\n### Files\n\n```\napp/\n  professor/\n    [id]/\n      page.tsx                            -- server component wrapper\ncomponents/\n  professor/\n    professor-info-panel.tsx              -- client: editable professor fields\n    professor-info-form.tsx               -- client: form fields for professor\n    email-draft-section.tsx               -- client: email drafting UI\n    chat-section.tsx                      -- client: AI chat interface\n    chat-message.tsx                      -- client: single chat bubble\n    publication-list.tsx                  -- client: key publications display\n    tag-input.tsx                         -- shared: tag/chip input for arrays\napp/\n  api/\n    gemini/\n      email/route.ts                     -- POST: generate email draft\n      chat/route.ts                      -- POST: chat with professor context\n      memory/route.ts                    -- POST: extract memory from chat\n```\n\n### 3.1 -- Professor Detail Page\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/professor/[id]/page.tsx`**\n\nThis is a server component. Since data is in localStorage (client-only), the page itself is thin:\n\n```tsx\nimport { ProfessorDetail } from '@/components/professor/professor-detail';\n\nexport default async function ProfessorPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {\n  const { id } = await params;\n  return <ProfessorDetail professorId={id} />;\n}\n```\n\nNote: In Next.js 16 with React 19, `params` is a Promise that must be awaited.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/professor/professor-detail.tsx`** (client component)\n\n- Reads professor by ID from storage\n- If not found, shows 404-like message\n- Three-section layout using Tabs or a sidebar-within-content approach:\n  1. Info Panel (left/top)\n  2. Email Draft (center)\n  3. AI Chat (right/bottom)\n- On desktop: side-by-side layout. Info panel on the left (fixed width), Email + Chat on the right (tabbed).\n- On mobile: stacked with tabs.\n\n### 3.2 -- Professor Info Panel\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/professor/professor-info-panel.tsx`**\n\n- Displays all professor fields\n- Each field is inline-editable (click to edit, blur to save)\n- Status selector (dropdown)\n- Research areas as editable tags (uses `TagInput` component)\n- Key publications as an editable list\n- Notes as a textarea\n- \"Delete Professor\" button with confirmation dialog\n- All changes call `storage.professors.update(id, { field: newValue })` and show toast\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/professor/tag-input.tsx`**\n\n- Reusable tag input component\n- Type text, press Enter/comma to add tag\n- Click X on tag to remove\n- Used for research areas, research interests, memory tags\n\n### 3.3 -- Email Drafting API Route\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/email/route.ts`**\n\n- Accepts POST with `{ professor: Professor, profile: Profile, memory: MemoryItem[], template: EmailTemplate }`\n- System prompt varies by template type (cold outreach vs follow-up vs thank you)\n- Instructs Gemini to write a personalized email referencing specific research overlap\n- Returns `{ content: string }`\n\n### 3.4 -- Email Draft Section\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/professor/email-draft-section.tsx`**\n\n- Template selector (Cold Outreach / Follow-Up / Thank You)\n- \"Generate Draft\" button\n- Textarea or simple rich text area for the draft content\n- Auto-saves on edit via debounce (500ms) to `storage.drafts.save()`\n- \"Copy to Clipboard\" button\n- Shows last generated/edited timestamps\n- Loading state during generation\n\n### 3.5 -- Chat API Route\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/chat/route.ts`**\n\n- Accepts POST with `{ messages: ChatMessage[], professor: Professor, profile: Profile, memory: MemoryItem[], draft: EmailDraft | null }`\n- Constructs a system prompt with full context (professor info, user profile, memories, current draft)\n- Sends conversation history to Gemini\n- Returns `{ content: string }`\n- Uses streaming if feasible (return a ReadableStream for progressive rendering)\n\n### 3.6 -- Memory Extraction API Route\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/memory/route.ts`**\n\n- Accepts POST with `{ messages: ChatMessage[] }` (latest exchange, typically last 2-4 messages)\n- System prompt tells Gemini: \"Extract any key facts, decisions, or insights worth remembering from this conversation. Return JSON array of `{ content: string, tags: string[] }` or empty array if nothing notable.\"\n- Called automatically after each assistant response in the chat\n\n### 3.7 -- Chat Section\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/professor/chat-section.tsx`**\n\n- Chat message list (scroll area, auto-scroll to bottom)\n- Input bar at bottom with send button\n- Messages rendered via `ChatMessage` component\n- On send:\n  1.

Return as JSON.\"\n- Returns the parsed profile data\n\n### 4.3 -- Profile Form\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/profile/profile-form.tsx`**\n\n- Form fields for all profile properties\n- Research interests as tag input\n- Auto-saves on change (debounced) to `storage.profile.update()`\n- \"Auto-fill from Resume\" button that triggers parsing\n\n### 4.4 -- Resume Upload\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/profile/resume-upload.tsx`**\n\n- Drag-and-drop zone or file input (accept PDF only)\n- On upload: read file as base64, store in profile, call `/api/gemini/resume`\n- Show parsed results for user to review\n- \"Apply to Profile\" button to merge parsed data into profile fields\n- Display current resume name + download/remove buttons\n\n### 4.5 -- Document Manager\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/profile/document-manager.tsx`**\n\n- List of uploaded documents grouped by category\n- Each document shows: name, category badge, upload date, download button, delete button\n- \"Upload Document\" button opens dialog\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/profile/document-upload-dialog.tsx`**\n\n- File input\n- Category selector (Resume, Transcript, SOP, LOR, Other)\n- Name field (auto-filled from filename)\n- On submit: read as base64, call `storage.documents.create()`\n\n### 4.6 -- Smart Memory\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/profile/smart-memory.tsx`**\n\n- Searchable list of memory items\n- Each item shows: content, source professor link, tags, date\n- \"Add Memory\" button for manual entry\n- Each item has edit and delete actions\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/profile/memory-item-card.tsx`**\n\n- Card displaying one memory item\n- Inline editing on click\n- Tags displayed as badges\n- Source professor as a link to their detail page\n- Delete with confirmation\n\n### Commit: \"feat: implement profile page with resume parsing, documents, and smart memory\"\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Data Export and Polish\n\n**Goal:** Build the export page, add final polish, optimize bundle.\n\n### Files\n\n```\napp/\n  export/\n    page.tsx                              -- export page\ncomponents/\n  export/\n    export-controls.tsx                   -- client: export/import buttons\n```\n\n### 5.1 -- Export Page\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/export/page.tsx`**\n\nSimple page with:\n- \"Export All Data\" button -- calls `storage.exportAll()`, creates a JSON blob, triggers download as `profreach-export-{date}.json`\n- \"Import Data\" button -- file input for JSON, calls `storage.importAll()` with confirmation dialog (warns about overwriting)\n- Shows data summary: X professors, Y documents, Z memory items, etc.\n\n### 5.2 -- Performance Optimization\n\n- Use `next/dynamic` for heavy components:\n  - `ChatSection` (loaded only on professor detail page)\n  - `SmartMemory` (loaded only on profile page memory tab)\n  - `DocumentManager` (loaded only on profile page documents tab)\n\n```typescript\nconst ChatSection = dynamic(() => import('@/components/professor/chat-section'), {\n  loading: () => <Skeleton className=\"h-96\" />,\n  ssr: false, // localStorage-dependent, no SSR needed\n});\n```\n\n- Mark all localStorage-dependent components with `'use client'` -- they cannot be server components anyway\n- Add proper Suspense boundaries around dynamic imports\n- Keep the layout shell (sidebar, header) as server components where possible\n\n### 5.3 -- Final Polish Items\n\n- Loading skeletons for all data-dependent sections\n- Empty states with illustrations/helpful text for each list\n- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+K for search, Escape to close dialogs\n- Responsive design: sidebar collapses to bottom nav on mobile\n- Dark mode support (the CSS variables from globals.css already support it)\n- Toast notifications for all CRUD operations\n- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete professor, delete document, import data)\n\n### Commit: \"feat: implement data export and performance optimizations\"\n\n---\n\n## Complete File Tree\n\n```\nprofreach/\n  .env.local                             -- GEMINI_API_KEY\n  app/\n    layout.tsx                           -- root layout (Geist fonts, Providers, AppShell)\n    globals.css                          -- Tailwind v4 + design tokens\n    page.tsx                             -- dashboard\n    professor/\n      [id]/\n        page.tsx                         -- professor detail\n    profile/\n      page.tsx                           -- profile\n    export/\n      page.tsx                           -- export/import\n    api/\n      gemini/\n        lookup/route.ts                  -- professor lookup (grounded search)\n        email/route.ts                   -- email draft generation\n        chat/route.ts                    -- professor-scoped chat\n        resume/route.ts                  -- resume PDF parsing\n        memory/route.ts                  -- memory extraction from chat\n  lib/\n    types.ts                             -- all TypeScript interfaces and type constants\n    storage.ts                           -- localStorage abstraction layer\n    constants.ts                         -- status colors, defaults, sort options\n    gemini.ts                            -- Gemini client initialization\n    utils.ts                             -- cn() from shadcn + custom helpers\n  hooks/\n    use-storage.ts                       -- reactive localStorage hook (useSyncExternalStore)\n    use-debounce.ts                      -- debounce hook\n  components/\n    providers.tsx                        -- client providers (Toaster)\n    layout/\n      sidebar.tsx                        -- navigation sidebar\n      header.tsx                         -- page header\n      app-shell.tsx                      -- sidebar + content wrapper\n    dashboard/\n      dashboard-stats.tsx                -- stat summary cards\n      add-professor-input.tsx            -- search input + lookup trigger\n      add-professor-dialog.tsx           -- review/edit professor before save\n      filter-bar.tsx                     -- search, filter, sort controls\n      professor-list.tsx                 -- professor card grid\n      professor-card.tsx                 -- single professor card\n      status-badge.tsx                   -- colored status badge\n    professor/\n      professor-detail.tsx               -- main detail layout (client)\n      professor-info-panel.tsx           -- editable professor info\n      tag-input.tsx                      -- reusable tag/chip input\n      publication-list.tsx               -- publications editor\n      email-draft-section.tsx            -- email drafting UI\n      chat-section.tsx                   -- AI chat interface\n      chat-message.tsx                   -- single chat bubble\n    profile/\n      profile-form.tsx                   -- personal info form\n      resume-upload.tsx                  -- resume upload + parsing\n      document-manager.tsx               -- document list + upload\n      document-upload-dialog.tsx         -- upload dialog\n      smart-memory.tsx                   -- memory list + management\n      memory-item-card.tsx               -- single memory card\n    export/\n      export-controls.tsx                -- export/import buttons + summary\n    ui/                                  -- shadcn/ui components (auto-generated)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Architectural Decisions\n\n### 1. Storage Event System\n\nThe storage layer dispatches a custom DOM event on every write. The `useStorageData` hook subscribes to this event via `useSyncExternalStore`. This means any component reading from storage automatically re-renders when any other component writes to it, without prop drilling or context.\n\n### 2. Server Components vs Client Components\n\nSince all data lives in localStorage, almost every feature component must be `'use client'`. The server components in this app are:\n- `app/layout.tsx` -- the root layout\n- `app/page.tsx`, `app/professor/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/profile/page.tsx`, `app/export/page.tsx` -- thin server wrappers that render client components\n- `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` and `components/layout/header.tsx` -- if they contain no interactivity\n\nThe API routes are server-side only (they hold the Gemini API key).\n\n### 3. AI Call Flow\n\nAll AI features follow the same pattern:\n1. Client component collects data from storage\n2. Client POSTs to `/api/gemini/[feature]` with the data\n3. API route constructs a prompt, calls Gemini, parses the response\n4. API route returns structured JSON to client\n5. Client writes result to storage\n\nThis keeps the API key server-side and the prompts centralized.\n\n### 4. Chat Streaming (Optional Enhancement)\n\nFor a better chat UX, the `/api/gemini/chat` route can return a `ReadableStream`:\n\n```typescript\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  // ... setup ...\n  const result = await model.generateContentStream({ contents });\n  const stream = new ReadableStream({\n    async start(controller) {\n      for await (const chunk of result.stream) {\n        controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(chunk.text()));\n      }\n      controller.close();\n    }\n  });\n  return new Response(stream, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' } });\n}\n```\n\nThe client reads the stream progressively and updates the UI character by character. This can be deferred to after the initial implementation works with non-streaming responses.\n\n### 5. Memory Extraction Timing\n\nMemory extraction is fire-and-forget after each assistant response. The flow:\n1. User sends message, assistant responds\n2. Both messages are saved to storage\n3. A background call to `/api/gemini/memory` is made with the recent exchange\n4. If items are returned, they are silently added to storage\n5. A subtle toast informs the user\n\nThis avoids blocking the chat UX while still capturing valuable information.\n\n---\n\n## Package Summary\n\n| Package | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `@google/generative-ai` | Gemini API client |\n| `uuid` | Generate unique IDs for all entities |\n| `@types/uuid` | TypeScript types for uuid |\n| `lucide-react` | Icon library (used by shadcn/ui) |\n| `sonner` | Toast notifications |\n| shadcn/ui components | button, input, label, textarea, select, badge, card, dialog, dropdown-menu, tabs, separator, scroll-area, sheet, tooltip, skeleton, toast, popover, command |\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Order Summary\n\n| Phase | What | Depends On | Commit |\n|-------|------|------------|--------|\n| 0 | Install deps, init shadcn | Nothing | `chore: install dependencies and initialize shadcn/ui` |\n| 1 | Types, storage, layout, hooks | Phase 0 | `feat: add type definitions, storage layer, layout shell` |\n| 2 | Dashboard + professor lookup | Phase 1 | `feat: implement dashboard with professor list and AI lookup` |\n| 3 | Professor detail + email + chat | Phase 1, 2 | `feat: implement professor detail with email drafting and AI chat` |\n| 4 | Profile + resume + docs + memory | Phase 1 | `feat: implement profile page with resume parsing and smart memory` |\n| 5 | Export + polish + optimization | Phase 1-4 | `feat: implement data export and performance optimizations` |\n\nNote: Phases 3 and 4 are largely independent of each other (both depend on Phase 1/2 for the storage layer). They could be built in parallel or in either order.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/storage.ts` - Core storage abstraction layer; every feature depends on this. Must be built first and built correctly since a future DB migration swaps only this file.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/types.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces and type constants. Every other file imports from here. Getting the data shapes right upfront prevents cascading changes.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/gemini.ts` - Server-side Gemini client initialization shared by all 5 API routes. The grounded search setup for professor lookup is particularly important.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/hooks/use-storage.ts` - The reactive hook using `useSyncExternalStore` that makes localStorage changes trigger React re-renders. Every client component depends on this for data access.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/chat/route.ts` - The most complex API route: it assembles professor context, profile, memories, draft, and conversation history into a coherent Gemini prompt. Gets the pattern right for all other AI routes."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a8ac472 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 42241\ntool_uses: 12\nduration_ms: 194490</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"276a6cd6-ee21-45f7-8304-738fb65ae2b8","timestamp":"2026-02-16T18:10:29.180Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need a detailed implementation plan for building \"Profreach\" - a professor outreach tracker for grad school applications.

It wraps localStorage behind a clean API so a future database migration only changes this one file.\n\nDesign principles:\n- Each \"collection\" (professors, documents, memory, chats, drafts) gets its own localStorage key: `profreach_professors`, `profreach_profile`, etc.\n- All reads/writes go through helper functions that handle JSON serialization.\n- Every mutation triggers a `CustomEvent` on `window` so React hooks can re-render.\n\n```typescript\nconst STORAGE_KEYS = {\n  professors: 'profreach_professors',\n  profile: 'profreach_profile',\n  documents: 'profreach_documents',\n  memory: 'profreach_memory',\n  chats: 'profreach_chats',\n  drafts: 'profreach_drafts',\n} as const;\n\nconst STORAGE_EVENT = 'profreach-storage-update';\n\nfunction read<T>(key: string, fallback: T): T { ... }\nfunction write<T>(key: string, data: T): void { ... dispatch event }\n\nexport const storage = {\n  professors: {\n    getAll(): Professor[] { return read(STORAGE_KEYS.professors, []); },\n    getById(id: string): Professor | undefined { ... },\n    create(data: Omit<Professor, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>): Professor { ... },\n    update(id: string, data: Partial<Professor>): Professor { ... },\n    delete(id: string): void { ... },\n  },\n  profile: {\n    get(): Profile { return read(STORAGE_KEYS.profile, DEFAULT_PROFILE); },\n    update(data: Partial<Profile>): Profile { ... },\n  },\n  documents: {\n    getAll(): Document[] { ... },\n    create(doc: Omit<Document, 'id' | 'uploadedAt'>): Document { ... },\n    delete(id: string): void { ... },\n  },\n  memory: {\n    getAll(): MemoryItem[] { ... },\n    add(item: Omit<MemoryItem, 'id' | 'createdAt'>): MemoryItem { ... },\n    update(id: string, data: Partial<MemoryItem>): MemoryItem { ... },\n    delete(id: string): void { ... },\n    search(query: string): MemoryItem[] { ... }, // simple text match\n  },\n  chats: {\n    getByProfessorId(professorId: string): ChatMessage[] { ... },\n    addMessage(professorId: string, message: Omit<ChatMessage, 'id' | 'createdAt'>): ChatMessage { ... },\n    clearByProfessorId(professorId: string): void { ... },\n  },\n  drafts: {\n    getByProfessorId(professorId: string): EmailDraft | null { ... },\n    save(professorId: string, data: Partial<EmailDraft>): EmailDraft { ... },\n  },\n  exportAll(): AppData { ... },\n  importAll(data: AppData): void { ... },\n};\n```\n\n### 1.4 -- React Hook for Storage\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/hooks/use-storage.ts`**\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n// Listens for the custom storage event and returns reactive data.\n// Example: const professors = useStorageCollection(() => storage.professors.getAll());\n// Automatically re-renders when storage changes.\nexport function useStorageData<T>(getter: () => T): T { ... }\n```\n\nUses `useSyncExternalStore` for safe concurrent React 19 usage. The subscribe function listens for the `profreach-storage-update` event on `window`.\n\n### 1.5 -- Debounce Hook\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/hooks/use-debounce.ts`**\n\nStandard debounce hook for search input, 300ms default.\n\n### 1.6 -- App Layout and Navigation\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`** (client component)\n\nA vertical sidebar with navigation links:\n- Dashboard (Home icon) -- `/`\n- Profile (User icon) -- `/profile`\n- Export (Download icon) -- `/export`\n\nUse `lucide-react` icons. Highlight active route using `usePathname()`.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/layout/header.tsx`** (server component)\n\nA top bar per page showing page title. Each page passes its own title.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/layout/app-shell.tsx`** (server component)\n\nWraps sidebar + main content area in a flex layout. The sidebar is fixed-width on the left, content scrolls independently.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/providers.tsx`** (client component)\n\nWraps `children` with the `<Toaster />` from sonner (for toast notifications).\n\n**Update: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/layout.tsx`**\n\n- Update metadata title/description to \"Profreach\"\n- Keep Geist fonts\n- Wrap `{children}` in `<Providers>` and `<AppShell>`\n- Update `globals.css` with design tokens for a distinctive look (custom accent color, refined spacing)\n\n**Update: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/globals.css`**\n\n- Keep the Tailwind v4 `@import \"tailwindcss\"` and `@theme inline` block\n- Add custom color variables for the Profreach brand (a warm accent color like amber/orange or a scholarly blue-violet)\n- Add custom scrollbar styles, selection color, focus ring overrides\n\n### Commit: \"feat: add type definitions, storage layer, layout shell, and navigation\"\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Dashboard Page\n\n**Goal:** Build the main professor list view with search, filtering, sorting, and the \"Add Professor\" input.\n\n### Files\n\n```\napp/\n  page.tsx                                -- dashboard server wrapper\ncomponents/\n  dashboard/\n    professor-list.tsx                    -- client: renders professor cards\n    professor-card.tsx                    -- client: single professor card\n    add-professor-input.tsx               -- client: input + Gemini lookup\n    add-professor-dialog.tsx              -- client: review/edit before saving\n    filter-bar.tsx                        -- client: filter/sort/search controls\n    status-badge.tsx                      -- shared status badge component\n    dashboard-stats.tsx                   -- summary stats at top\napp/\n  api/\n    gemini/\n      lookup/route.ts                    -- POST: professor lookup\n```\n\n### 2.1 -- Gemini Server Client\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/gemini.ts`**\n\n```typescript\nimport { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';\n\nconst genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY!);\n\nexport function getGeminiModel(modelName = 'gemini-2.0-flash') {\n  return genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: modelName });\n}\n\n// For search-grounded lookups\nexport function getGroundedModel() {\n  return genAI.getGenerativeModel({\n    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',\n    tools: [{ googleSearchRetrieval: {} }],\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 2.2 -- Professor Lookup API Route\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/lookup/route.ts`**\n\n- Accepts POST with `{ query: string }` (name+university or URL)\n- Uses the grounded Gemini model\n- System prompt instructs Gemini to return a structured JSON matching the `Professor` shape (minus id, createdAt, updatedAt, status)\n- Parses the JSON from Gemini's response, validates it, returns it\n- Error handling for rate limits, malformed responses\n\n### 2.3 -- Dashboard Page\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/page.tsx`**\n\nThis is a server component that renders the page shell.

No need for global state management.\n\n### 2.6 -- Professor List and Card\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/professor-list.tsx`**\n\n- Reads all professors via `useStorageData(() => storage.professors.getAll())`\n- Applies filters and sorting from props\n- Renders a grid of `ProfessorCard` components\n- Empty state when no professors exist\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/professor-card.tsx`**\n\n- Card showing: name, university, department, country, research areas as badges, status badge, last contact\n- Clicking navigates to `/professor/[id]`\n- Quick status dropdown to change status inline\n- Uses `Link` from `next/link`\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/status-badge.tsx`**\n\n- Reusable component: takes an `ApplicationStatus`, renders a colored badge\n- Uses the color map from `constants.ts`\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/dashboard/dashboard-stats.tsx`**\n\n- Row of stat cards at the top: Total Professors, Emails Sent, Responses, etc.\n- Computed from professor list statuses\n\n### Commit: \"feat: implement dashboard with professor list, filtering, and AI lookup\"\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Professor Detail Page\n\n**Goal:** Build the full professor detail view with info editing, email drafting, and AI chat.\n\n### Files\n\n```\napp/\n  professor/\n    [id]/\n      page.tsx                            -- server component wrapper\ncomponents/\n  professor/\n    professor-info-panel.tsx              -- client: editable professor fields\n    professor-info-form.tsx               -- client: form fields for professor\n    email-draft-section.tsx               -- client: email drafting UI\n    chat-section.tsx                      -- client: AI chat interface\n    chat-message.tsx                      -- client: single chat bubble\n    publication-list.tsx                  -- client: key publications display\n    tag-input.tsx                         -- shared: tag/chip input for arrays\napp/\n  api/\n    gemini/\n      email/route.ts                     -- POST: generate email draft\n      chat/route.ts                      -- POST: chat with professor context\n      memory/route.ts                    -- POST: extract memory from chat\n```\n\n### 3.1 -- Professor Detail Page\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/professor/[id]/page.tsx`**\n\nThis is a server component. Since data is in localStorage (client-only), the page itself is thin:\n\n```tsx\nimport { ProfessorDetail } from '@/components/professor/professor-detail';\n\nexport default async function ProfessorPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {\n  const { id } = await params;\n  return <ProfessorDetail professorId={id} />;\n}\n```\n\nNote: In Next.js 16 with React 19, `params` is a Promise that must be awaited.\n\n**File: `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/components/professor/professor-detail.tsx`** (client component)\n\n- Reads professor by ID from storage\n- If not found, shows 404-like message\n- Three-section layout using Tabs or a sidebar-within-content approach:\n  1.

Storage Event System\n\nThe storage layer dispatches a custom DOM event on every write. The `useStorageData` hook subscribes to this event via `useSyncExternalStore`. This means any component reading from storage automatically re-renders when any other component writes to it, without prop drilling or context.\n\n### 2. Server Components vs Client Components\n\nSince all data lives in localStorage, almost every feature component must be `'use client'`. The server components in this app are:\n- `app/layout.tsx` -- the root layout\n- `app/page.tsx`, `app/professor/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/profile/page.tsx`, `app/export/page.tsx` -- thin server wrappers that render client components\n- `components/layout/app-shell.tsx` and `components/layout/header.tsx` -- if they contain no interactivity\n\nThe API routes are server-side only (they hold the Gemini API key).\n\n### 3. AI Call Flow\n\nAll AI features follow the same pattern:\n1. Client component collects data from storage\n2. Client POSTs to `/api/gemini/[feature]` with the data\n3. API route constructs a prompt, calls Gemini, parses the response\n4. API route returns structured JSON to client\n5. Client writes result to storage\n\nThis keeps the API key server-side and the prompts centralized.\n\n### 4. Chat Streaming (Optional Enhancement)\n\nFor a better chat UX, the `/api/gemini/chat` route can return a `ReadableStream`:\n\n```typescript\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  // ... setup ...\n  const result = await model.generateContentStream({ contents });\n  const stream = new ReadableStream({\n    async start(controller) {\n      for await (const chunk of result.stream) {\n        controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(chunk.text()));\n      }\n      controller.close();\n    }\n  });\n  return new Response(stream, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' } });\n}\n```\n\nThe client reads the stream progressively and updates the UI character by character. This can be deferred to after the initial implementation works with non-streaming responses.\n\n### 5. Memory Extraction Timing\n\nMemory extraction is fire-and-forget after each assistant response. The flow:\n1. User sends message, assistant responds\n2. Both messages are saved to storage\n3. A background call to `/api/gemini/memory` is made with the recent exchange\n4. If items are returned, they are silently added to storage\n5. A subtle toast informs the user\n\nThis avoids blocking the chat UX while still capturing valuable information.\n\n---\n\n## Package Summary\n\n| Package | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `@google/generative-ai` | Gemini API client |\n| `uuid` | Generate unique IDs for all entities |\n| `@types/uuid` | TypeScript types for uuid |\n| `lucide-react` | Icon library (used by shadcn/ui) |\n| `sonner` | Toast notifications |\n| shadcn/ui components | button, input, label, textarea, select, badge, card, dialog, dropdown-menu, tabs, separator, scroll-area, sheet, tooltip, skeleton, toast, popover, command |\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Order Summary\n\n| Phase | What | Depends On | Commit |\n|-------|------|------------|--------|\n| 0 | Install deps, init shadcn | Nothing | `chore: install dependencies and initialize shadcn/ui` |\n| 1 | Types, storage, layout, hooks | Phase 0 | `feat: add type definitions, storage layer, layout shell` |\n| 2 | Dashboard + professor lookup | Phase 1 | `feat: implement dashboard with professor list and AI lookup` |\n| 3 | Professor detail + email + chat | Phase 1, 2 | `feat: implement professor detail with email drafting and AI chat` |\n| 4 | Profile + resume + docs + memory | Phase 1 | `feat: implement profile page with resume parsing and smart memory` |\n| 5 | Export + polish + optimization | Phase 1-4 | `feat: implement data export and performance optimizations` |\n\nNote: Phases 3 and 4 are largely independent of each other (both depend on Phase 1/2 for the storage layer). They could be built in parallel or in either order.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/storage.ts` - Core storage abstraction layer; every feature depends on this. Must be built first and built correctly since a future DB migration swaps only this file.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/types.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces and type constants. Every other file imports from here. Getting the data shapes right upfront prevents cascading changes.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/lib/gemini.ts` - Server-side Gemini client initialization shared by all 5 API routes. The grounded search setup for professor lookup is particularly important.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/hooks/use-storage.ts` - The reactive hook using `useSyncExternalStore` that makes localStorage changes trigger React re-renders. Every client component depends on this for data access.\n- `/Users/shakirulhkhan/Documents/Developer/experiments/profreach/app/api/gemini/chat/route.ts` - The most complex API route: it assembles professor context, profile, memories, draft, and conversation history into a coherent Gemini prompt. Gets the pattern right for all other AI routes."}],"totalDurationMs":194490,"totalTokens":42241,"totalToolUseCount":12,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":656,"cache_read_input_tokens":31188,"output_tokens":10396,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":656,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3139f3af-23da-4410-9857-2bad2529de42"}
